Hi Friends,

Cooking is my passion and I just love to cook healthy and Tasty dishes of all kinds in a very easy and simple way. Here I want to share my learning and journey in cooking. I am inspired by many great cooks but I love to develop my own style in cooking. I also read a lot so I also like to share some details like origin, texture, taste, etc. about the recipes.

You will find new recipes every Monday and Wednesday.

Thank you for reading....

### Bengali Puja Path

Traditions and religious customs used to be an integral part of our upbringing. Religious customs and festivals give us an opportunity to forget our mundane worries and celebrate the positivity and vibrance of life. These cultural observances not only bind us but also help us define our cultural roots. Hence it is important to pass this to the future generations.
With this in mind, we are starting “Bengali Puja Path” - a platform for social and cultural interaction where we familiarise ourselves with Bengali culture, rituals, and traditions. Let us exchange our warmth, love and wishes through this platform.
